Used ChatGPT to help me understand the project description as i didn't get it fully from the pdf given.
Then i used it in tasks 3.1 and 3.3 just for verification of my code and if there is any logical error.
I used it in task 3.2 to understand the task then to help me with the calculate_energy function.
After all was done, I was facing a problem that my project was passing all the tests but not owl_3.
I used Cody AI coding assistant to help me debug the code and fix the error. It couldn't find it directly
but after I read the forum of other students faced the same problem, I realized the error and fixed it.

some of the prompt I was giving in the begining then ofcourse there will be follow up questions.

Cody:
I already wrote all the functions correctly but I am failing only one test out of 31 tests. can you please read the code, analyse it and if there is any bug or logical error tell me (don't change anything).
the code is passing all the tests except one only called owl_3. I think the size is different or something like this. Try to read the full code once again and check whether there is a problem with me using w0 and img->w because they are supposed to be different things.

ChatGPT:
I attached a pdf of project description, I want you to break down and to explain me the tasks I must do in details and in an easy way (dont implement any code).


how to write to a file in c?


void statistics(struct image* img) {
    // TODO implement (assignment 3.1)
    /* implement and use the function:
     * image_brightness
     */
    uint8_t avg_brightness = image_brightness(img);
    printf(" width : %u\n", img->w);
    printf(" height : %u\n", img->h);
    printf(" brightness : %u\n", avg_brightness);
}

uint8_t image_brightness(struct image* img) {
    // TODO implement (assignment 3.1)
    uint8_t avg_brightness = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < (img->h * img->w) - 1; i++) {
        avg_brightness =
            avg_brightness +
            ((img->pixels[i].r + img->pixels[i].g + img->pixels[i].b) / 3);
    }
    avg_brightness = avg_brightness / (img->h * img->w);
    return avg_brightness;
}
Is this code correct? because i am failing the test


ok, now can you help me in the same way with task 3.2 after going through the pdf again.
Here is the codes needs to be changed (dont write the code your own but just help me with explaining the concept)

void find_print_min_path(struct image* img) {
    // TODO implement (assignment 3.2)
    /* implement and use the functions:
     * - calculate_energy
     * - calculate_min_energy_column
     * - calculate_optimal_path
     * in energy.c
     */
    NOT_IMPLEMENTED;
    UNUSED(img);
}

void calculate_energy(uint32_t* const energy, struct image* const img,
                      int const w) {
    // TODO implement (assignment 3.2)
    NOT_IMPLEMENTED;
    UNUSED(energy);
    UNUSED(img);
    UNUSED(w);
}


void image_write_to_file(struct image* img, const char* filename) {
    // TODO implement (assignment 3.3)
    FILE* file = fopen(filename, "w");
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("File is not available!");
    } else {
        fprintf(file, "P3\n");
        fprintf(file, "%u %u\n", img->w, img->h);
        fprintf(file, "255");
        for (int h = 0; h < img->h; h++) {
            for (int w = 0; w < img->w; w++) {
                fprintf(file, "%u %u %u", img->pixels[yx_index(h, w, img->w)].r,
                        img->pixels[yx_index(h, w, img->w)].g,
                        img->pixels[yx_index(h, w, img->w)].b);
            }
            fprintf(file, "\n");
        }
    }
}

This was my code for image_write_to_file, can you please check it?
